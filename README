Mobile USTC Website is a project I finished in July 2012. It is a website for presenting mobile apps of University of Science and Technology of China, leading students to download and set up them on their smart phone.

They are simple two parts. The first part is the homepage, listing all the apps that I have to show to the students. The second part is the inner page. Each application has its own homepage that tells students users why they should use it?and how it can be used well.
